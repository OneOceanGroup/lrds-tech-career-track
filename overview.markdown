# What’s a Career Framework?
The Engineering Career Path Framework is your source for how to achieve impact for your role and Squad and how to grow in your engineering career. For managers, it can help you set expectations with your teams and hold them accountable for their work.
What the Career Framework is not
This framework is not a promotion checklist for your role; rather, it’s designed to help you figure out what your impact could look like at the next level.
 
This framework is not an exhaustive list of examples and behaviors; each responsibility includes three to four key behaviors that serve as guide for how to think about your work. Consequently, you’ll need to meet with your manager to define your impact goals and align on the expectations for your role. 
# What’s in a Career Framework?
This framework is broken down into two components:
Level Expectations define the extent of influence, autonomy, and areas of Ownership at every level; these expectations are the what that determines the difference between an SW3 and SW4, for example
Core and Craft Responsibilities define the key behaviors specific to your role and Squad; these behaviors help you identify how you work to deliver impact based on your level expectations
# How to navigate this framework
OneOcean measures the success of its employees largely on business impact with the *Contribution & Development Voyage (CDV)* process. Anchor your work first and foremost on creating long-term impact.
 
Next, ground yourself in the expectations for your level and Squad. For each level, you’ll find a one-line summary description and the role’s extent of influence, autonomy, and areas of Ownership for impact. 
 
Review the expected behaviors for that level across the Results, Direction, Talent, Culture pillars from the Core Responsibilities. Read your Craft expectations, which are the per discipline technical capabilities you need to master at that level. Finally, meet with your manager to set your goals for the CDV period.
