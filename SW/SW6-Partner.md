| **Impact**| I identify and execute on significant group/company-wide opportunities by understanding how technical capabilities meet customer needs. I proactively work with business owners to help them understand these new capabilities and work with them to build the right roadmap for the business. <br/> I execute large projects to a very high standard ‚Äî e.g. against a tight deadline with significant consequences of failure, or in a manner that allows rapid learning to clarify significant ambiguity, or to a standard of quality well exceeding that of the current system (though not all simultaneously) <br/> I proactively identify and help to refocus my team's efforts when projects are off-course or not technically feasible and results aren‚Äôt moving the needle for our business/team goals or serving the needs of customers in a meaningful way <br/> I know which levers to pull to drive meaningful results and understand the wider, cross-functional implications of my work |
| **Ownership**| I have a sense of responsibility and obligation to act on opportunities I see across the engineering org/company <br/> I transcend organizational boundaries by taking a holistic view of my group‚Äôs goals and taking responsibility across my group, not just within my immediate scope of ownership                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Decision Making**| I act thoughtfully and decisively in critical situations even when making challenging or unpopular decisions <br/> I'm able to reach the right decision despite conflicting perspectives                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Personal growth**    | I proactively ask for feedback from those I work with and identify ways to act upon it <br/> I have self-awareness about my strengths and areas for development <br/> I drive discussions with my manager about aspirational goals and seek out opportunities to learn and grow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Like Staff Engineers, I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. I design systems that are far from my previous experience, anticipating scale and scope beyond the current requirements at LRDS or in areas otherwise unexplored. I make or participate in discussions around making sweeping technical choices that lack clearly correct answers, but am able to articulate the rationale and technical vision behind those choices. I partner with cross-functional stakeholders to identify major new business opportunities unlocked by technical capabilities.

| **Code fluency**        | The expectations for code fluency do not go up beyond L3 (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area)                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| **Architecture design** | I can design systems that require research on what is possible rather than relying on my past experience, and where, consequently, a significant portion of the challenge is designing an appropriately staged validation plan. <br/> I define the high level systems we need to build to meet strategic objectives |
| **Technical strategy**  | I am responsible for making technical choices that have no one clearly correct answer but whose consequences have a sweeping effect across my scope in the organization <br/> I rally my organization around those choices by providing a clear rationale and technical vision backing them                         |
