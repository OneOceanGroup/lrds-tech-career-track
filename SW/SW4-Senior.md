## ‚å®Ô∏èCraft

I play a role in ensuring the quality of my team‚Äôs technical work, both code and software designs. I am responsible for designing the software or systems required in my area of ownership and ensuring that they meet their design objectives. My understanding of business context and purpose enables me to make technical decisions aligned with longer term needs, not just immediate requirements.

| **Responsibility**      | **Key Behaviours**                                           |
| :---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Code Fluency**        | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>The expectations for code fluency do not go up beyond *Senior level (SW3)* (though some specialist engineers may go deep in this area)</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Software design**     | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>I am able to give quality feedback on designs written by other members of my team, asking probing, insightful questions that solidify choices and surface erroneous assumptions<br/><li>I effectively and quickly debug cross-module issues, and may intuit where bugs might lie due to my deep knowledge of the libraries, platforms, and systems that my software relies on</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Architecture design** | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>I‚Äôm able to create coherent designs with multiple components interacting across API or system boundaries; bugs do not creep in at the boundaries between components due to mismatches in expectations of what is technically feasible<br/><li>I‚Äôm capable of rolling out a component or major feature (and deprecating an existing system or feature) reliably - including appropriate monitoring, paging, etc are in place, and that failure domains are understood and characterized appropriately before large scale rollout. For early stage products, I am able to roll out with an eye toward achieving learning goals untainted by poor quality.<br/><li>I design clear success metrics and achieve those metrics consistently post-launch through the lifetime of the system or feature. For early stage products, those success metrics may be oriented around learning goals rather than usage goals, given the inherent unpredictability of achieving product/market fit.</li></ul>{:/} |
