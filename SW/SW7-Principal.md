## ‚å®Ô∏èCraft

Like Staff Engineers and Principal Engineers, I have a well-rounded set of technical skills and development methodologies, and apply them with a sophisticated approach that is best suited for each project. The primary craft difference between Principal Engineers and Senior Principal Engineers is the scope at which their work applies.
